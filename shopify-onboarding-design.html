          <h4 class="text-center second-heading shopify-sub-heading">The Onboarding Process</h4>
          <div class="col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3">
            <p>Getting a customer to sign up is only half the battle. When they finally open a product there is plenty of time for customers to get confused, not find the help they need, spend too much time on tasks that are suppose to be simple and ultimately leave. A solid on-boarding process focuses on providing a successful experience to customer from the time they sign up as a trial user to the time they subscribe as a paying customer. The on-boarding process helps customers derive value from the product post-subscriptions 
            decreasing the chance they may leave after paying one or two times.</p>
            <p><strong>An effective on boarding process is essential to:</strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Decrease the immediate drop-offs that happen after a customer signs-up for a trial.</li>
              <li>Increasing trial to paid customer conversion rates.</li>
              <li>Decrease churn from customer groups that only subscribes for 30 to 90 days.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>A well thought-out on-boarding process should <strong>guide the user through a series of success metrics</strong>.</p>
            <p>The Shopify trial is 14 days. It is important to <strong>look at the tasks the most valuable users completed in the first 24 to 48 hours after signing up</strong> and model the process based on those success metrics.</p>
            <p><i>For example:</i></p>
            <ol>
              <li>In 24 hours the user most likely to subscribe added 1 products to their store.</li>
              <li>In 48 hours the user most likely to subscribe added 5 products to their store.</li>
              <li>By the end of the trial, users that paid chose their theme and opened their store for business.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><i>Questions to ask from data:</i></p>
            <ol>
              <li>What percentage of trial users actually complete each step in the journey below?</li>
              <li>How many users drop off and leave Shopify at each step? Which step has the most drop offs?</li>
              <li>How many steps are completed before a customer decides not to subscribe to Shopify?</li>
              <li>What range of tasks do users have completed when they sign up for a trial?</li>
              <li>What is the churn? How long does a customer keep their plan after the trial before cancelling?</li>
              <li>What steps does the customer has completed before unsubscribing? (looking only at customers 30 to 90 days after trial)</li>
              <li>Where does a customer struggle before unsubscribing in the 90 day period post conversion?</li>
            </ol>
            <p><i>Questions to ask from user tests & customer support:</i></p>
            <ol>
              <li>What do customers complain most about during the 14 day trial?</li>
              <li>Where do customers get stuck when they first use the Shopify platform?</li>
              <li>Where do customers struggle before unsubscribing in the 90 day period post conversion?</li>

                  <p>Nikita creates custom merchandize and Shopify stores for YouTubers. He is
                  also playing around with dropshipping businesses. He thinks Shopify is great
                  to start a store but may move to Wordpress for more customizability.</p>
                  <p><i>Pain Points</i></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The form asking for my address was unnecessary. I had to go into my payments settings to change my currency anyway.</li>
                    <li>I was still lost on the Home page even though the form asked too many questions from me already.</li>
                    <li>I clicked on every single link in the navigation panel to figure out how to set up my store.</li>
                    <li>To import products I used Oberlo. I heard about it from a friend and that is the only reason I used Shopify.</li>
                    <li>Finding how to change payment options and currency was confusing.</li>
                    <li>The customize theme page is a bit too much to start. I didn’t know how to add a new page or what Collection was.</li>
                    <li>I’m getting too many emails (like 2 a day) with videos and tutorials. Why can’t those be integrated into the platform instead?</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><i>Insights</i></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>It would be nice to know the work flow at the beginning and have an example of how people set-up stores.</li>
                    <li>There should be a guide pointing me to where I should start after signing-up.</li>
                    <li>Third party apps, especially for Drop shipping, should be suggested when signing-up.</li>
                    <li>I loved the Dropshipping guide. When I was building my store I had to exit to other parts of Shopify to find it again. It would be nice for the guides to be included while I set up.</li>
                    <li>I was excited to share my store with my friends. Can you make that easier?</li>

                  <p><i>Story</i></p>
                  <p>Chris used Shopify to sell his 3D printing product but gave up on first try.
                  He hired an expensive developer
                  from Crew to build a customized store. Eventually the developer went back to design
                  a custom theme for Chris using Shopify. Chris still has a love hate relationship
                  with the blogging system (only part of Shopif he touches).</p>
                  <p><i>Pain Points</i></p>
                  <p>"I hate this screen <span class="shopify-orange">[in reference to the Home screen
                  after answering form questions and setting up store name]</span>.
                  I have no idea where to go. There's so many options. Do I make a theme?
                  Do I add products?
                  What do I need to do to get my store running? Where shold I go first? 
                  There's actually no direction at all once you get to this page, other than the button trying to get me to sign up for a plan (even though I haven't even
                  done anything yet). There's too many options and im not far enough in the process to understand them."</p>
                  <p><i>Insights</i></p>
                  <ul style="text-align: left">
                    <li>If Chris was able to customize his theme quickly on his own, he
                    would have signed-up as a paying customer faster.</li>
                    <li>If he had steps to guide him, he would have been less overwhlemed and
                    knew exactly the time commitment required.</li>
                    <li>If a message told him about the Shopify marketplace he would have hired
                    an expert, saving time and money.</li>

          all about product and what to do next on a bigger scale 5) industry examples with 6 different companies and their
          various approaces to on-boarding.-->
